# XGBoost

Mandolin provides a wrapper for XGBoost.  The standard Mandolin file format is used (rather than XGBoost's native
format). The wrapper also facilitates use of model selection over XGBoost hyper-parameters. (see . . . )

## Splice Example

A small excerpt of the full Splice dataset is used here to demonstrate the utility of XGBoost
for modeling problems best captured with a non-linear classifier. The example can be run via:

    cd $MANDOLIN/examples/splice
    java -Djava.library.path=$MANDOLIN/mandolin-mx/pre-compiled/xgboost/linux -Xmx2g \
        -cp ../../dist/mandolin-mx-0.3.6.jar --conf splice.conf

The default `splice.conf` file in this example runs Mandolin in `train-test` mode. Here, with a small dataset,
the training file is used as the test file.  This is a big *no-no*, generally, but can be helpful to see
how well the model is fitting the training data. We can perform a more meaningful experiment by running
cross validation on the training data. This is triggered by simply setting the `test-file` to null which can
be done by editing the `splice.conf` file or overriding on the command-line as follows:

     java -Djava.library.path=$MANDOLIN/mandolin-mx/pre-compiled/xgboost/linux -Xmx2g \
        -cp ../../dist/mandolin-mx-0.3.6.jar --conf splice.conf mandolin.xg.test-file=null

The progress and evaluation metrics across 5 folds are logged to the console after each epoch/round/iteration
of training.

### Training a model

Running in `train-test` mode is good for experimentation, whether using cross validation or a validation/test
dataset. We can train a model to be saved for making subsequent predictions by running in
`train` mode.

    java -Djava.library.path=$MANDOLIN/mandolin-mx/pre-compiled/xgboost/linux -Xmx2g \
        -cp ../../dist/mandolin-mx-0.3.6.jar --conf splice.conf mandolin.mode=train

This will save a model in the file specified via the configuration attribute `mandolin.xg.model-file`.
If certain configruation options are set to non-null values, some side-effects of the training
process may be realized. In the example here, the attribute `mandolin.xg.feature-importance-file`
is set to non-null and Mandolin will provide each feature with it's associated Gain
according to XGBoost in file provided.

### Making Predictions and Evaluating

The trained model can be used to make predictions on a held out test dataset and provide
an evaluation by running Mandolin in `predict-eval` mode.  In this case, we could evaluate
the model on the training data (again, a held out test set should be used in practice) via:

    java -Djava.library.path=$MANDOLIN/mandolin-mx/pre-compiled/xgboost/linux -Xmx2g \
        -cp ../../dist/mandolin-mx-0.3.6.jar --conf splice.conf mandolin.mode=predict-eval \
	mandolin.xg.prediction-file=outputs.1

This will take the trained model file (specified via `mandolin.xg.model-file` in `splice.conf`)
and apply it to the labeled instances in `mandolin.xg.test-file`. The resulting predictions
are placed in the file `outputs.1` as specified via
`mandolin.xg.prediction-file`. As this is a binary classification task, the prediction file
format has three columns:

    ID, response, value

The `ID` refers to an optional unique ID for each test instance that can be specified by including
a `#` symbol followed by the ID on the input file.   This defaults to -1 if no IDs are specified,
as is the case here.  The `response` field provides the probability of the instance being
positive according to the model. Note that the positive label (in this example `+1`) should
be the first label in the `mandolin.xg.labels` file. The `value` field provides the "ground truth" label
for the instance as it appears in the input file.

### Making Predictions on Novel Data without Ground Truth

Tuning ML algorithms is done on training and test datasets with available ground truth to ascertain
accuracy/performance. Ultimately models are designed to be used to make predictions on data
without any available ground truth.  Mandolin models can be used to make predictions by running
the software in `predict` mode. This assumes that the test file in `mandolin.xg.test-file` includes
feature vectors (just like the training and test instances with labels), but that the left-most
column is removed - i.e. no label is provided. An example file without labels is provided with the example
called `rawtest.vecs`. Our trained model can be used to make predictions on these intances by invoking:

    java -Djava.library.path=$MANDOLIN/mandolin-mx/pre-compiled/xgboost/linux -Xmx2g \
        -cp ../../dist/mandolin-mx-0.3.6.jar --conf splice.conf mandolin.mode=predict \
	mandolin.xg.test-file=rawtest.vecs mandolin.xg.prediction-file=outputs.2

Since the ground truth labels are not provided here, the resulting prediction file, `outputs.2`
will not contain the final `value` column.

While using `predict` mode can be convenient for batch processing data, using the learnt model
to make predictions programmatically is often better for embedding within an application.

Mandolin
========

Mandolin is a tool for developing machine learning-based prediction models. It provides capabilities
such as:

* A rich configuration system for declaratively specifying models
* Fast distributed training using Apache Spark
* Large-scale, robust concurrent model selection/tuning
    * Concurrent evaluation using Apache Spark
    * Adaptive model selection using Bayesian Optimization techniques and Hyperband
    * Declarative specification of the model space
* Deep learning via MXNet
    * Includes support for training with GPUs
    * Specification of complex neural networks via the configuration system
 * Gradient boosted trees via XGBoost
 * Linear models and multi-layered perceptrons with a variety of loss functions
 * Optional and seamless standalone use (without Apache Spark)

Mandolin also contains an API extension based on **spark.ml**.
This allows Mandolin models to be used directly within the MLLib ecosystem, leveraging
other datastructures, tools, and MLLib's rich ML Pipeline framework.
